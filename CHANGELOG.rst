-----
.. _v0.2: https://github.com/mikecokina/puppet-warp/tree/release/0.2

**Release date:** 2023-06-02

**Features**

- Wavefront loader supports following forms of `face` definitions:

    - f v1 v2 v3 ....
    - f v1/vt1 v2/vt2 v3/vt3 ...
    - f v1/vt1/vn1 v2/vt2/vn2 v3/vt3/vn3 ...
    - f v1//vn1 v2//vn2 v3//vn3 ...

**Fixes**

- `Demo` loader supports scaling factor as `FLOAT` instead of `INT` what also allows to decrease size of supplied triangular mesh
- Since there was issue with some Python versions and `triangle` package availability, requirements for library are decreased to `20200424`
- Numpy is not fixed to the single version anymore
